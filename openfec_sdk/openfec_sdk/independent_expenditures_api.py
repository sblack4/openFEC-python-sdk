    OpenFEC

    This API allows you to explore the way candidates and committees fund their campaigns.    The FEC API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text and field-specific searches on FEC data. [Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly.    There is a lot of data, but a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check out contributor information in schedule_a.    Get an [API key here](https://api.data.gov/signup/). That will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get a key for 120 calls per minute to [APIinfo@fec.gov](mailto:apiinfo@fec.gov). You can also ask questions and discuss the data in the [FEC data Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data). API changes will also be added to this group in advance of the change.    The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data.    A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations. [Learn more here](https://www.fec.gov/updates/sale-or-use-contributor-information/).    [View our source code](https://github.com/fecgov/openFEC). We welcome issues and pull requests!  # noqa: E501

             Schedule E covers the line item expenditures for independent expenditures. For example, if a super PAC bought ads on TV to oppose a federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with the expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate.  An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication \"expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party or its agents.\"  Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in `/schedule/schedule_e/`.  Due to the large quantity of Schedule E filings, this endpoint is not paginated by page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For example, when sorting by `expenditure_amount`, you might receive a page of results with the following pagination information:  ```  \"pagination\": {     \"count\": 152623,     \"last_indexes\": {       \"last_index\": \"3023037\",       \"last_expenditure_amount\": -17348.5     },     \"per_page\": 20,     \"pages\": 7632   } } ```  To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=3023037` and `last_expenditure_amount=` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.  Note: because the Schedule E data includes many records, counts for large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.   # noqa: E501
